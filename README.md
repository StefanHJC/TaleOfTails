#### TBS developed during my internship in Lesta Games Academy 2022-2023.
This game is about three warrior cats who are trying to escape from rats dungeon and restore justice!

During development our team was inspired by HoMM V and King's Bounty: The Legend.

Here is some [gameplay demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZTvbHCd3gQ "Gameplay demo video")

At the first you need to take look at
[GameBootstrapper.cs](https://github.com/StefanHJC/TaleOfTails/blob/master/Assets/Scripts/Core/Infrastructure/GameBootstrapper.cs),
[Game.cs](https://github.com/StefanHJC/TaleOfTails/blob/master/Assets/Scripts/Core/Infrastructure/Game.cs) and 
[GameStateMachine.cs](https://github.com/StefanHJC/TaleOfTails/blob/master/Assets/Scripts/Core/Infrastructure/GameFSM/GameStateMachine.cs) to understand how game works

Some code here need to be refactored :)
